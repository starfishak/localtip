Interest Service
This service is used for all operations where the users personal preference/interest plays a role. For example, "Filter" chips on the homepage, generating the cards where users select their preferences, and toggling categories.

The service is the only service in the app that uses the Ionic Storage API for local storage.

Methods are documented accordingly.

The file category-list.ts is the default category object used for a new user. All interests are initially toggled on.
